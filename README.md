Created an E-Commerce website where navigation has three options [Product, Dashboard, My Cart]. In “Product” a data table is created which shows all data about all products and there also options for add, edit and delete product. Here sorting and pagination method is applied on all products. In “Dashboard” for all products shows its data with add product option using Card. By using add product option we can add product in “My Chart” which product will buy later. In “My Cart” option for all products shows its data which are added from “Dashboard”. Delete option is disabled for the product which is added in “My Cart”. We used Angular Material for design out UI, RxJs for component communication, Node as Backend and Mongo as Database. For deployment of the Project in cloud, we used Netlify and Heroku.
